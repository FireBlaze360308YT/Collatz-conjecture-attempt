The file main.py contains the program to test the collatz conjecture for a given number varying the power. U can set the function u want,
u can set the number u wawnt to try and u can set the starting power.
The script in a loop will count the number of steps it takes for the number set to reappear in the sequence, after that it clears the counter and increases the power by one.
The script is infinite but when stopped it will output a csv file with the data.

the daje.py file is just a script to test the amount of steps a numbers takes to fall to 1 at any power.
